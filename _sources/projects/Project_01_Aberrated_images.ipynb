    "Real imaging systems have a finite resolution set by the diffraction limit. Given a point source emitting a spherical EM field, a real lens will propagate the field from the object plane to the imaging plane, projecting a pattern which we call the imaging response function, or [point spread function (PSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function), of the system. For any object with finite size, we can think of the resultant image as being formed by a sum over the PSF associated with each point in the object, i.e. a convolution.\n",

Its first set of zeros are located at $\\rho\\approx3.83$, for a dimensionless radial component $\\rho$. \n",

    "To answer the rest of the questions in first chunk of this project we will use images from the **Number_estimate** and **Heavy_tails** datasets. This data was generated in the ImageSimulation.ipynb, found attached to this project. The images in the **Heavy_tails** dataset depict cold atom gases of variable $\\sigma_{xy}$ and $\\sigma_z$, at a fixed large atom number ($N=100000$), and those in the **Number_estimate** dataset contain images of a large isotropic ($\\sigma_{xy}=\\sigma_z=20$ um) gas across a range of small atom numbers and shots.\n",

    "In generating these images, there are handful of fixed hyperparameters chosen to match a realistic set of experimental conditions. Here we are imaging a thermal gas of Rb$^{87}$ atoms with a $\\lambda=780.2$ nm (near-infrared) light. That light is collected as by one of two imaging system: a (relatively) high numerical aperture ($\\text{NA}=0.4$) lens and a lower resolution ($\\text{NA}=0.2$) one. The image is projected on to a camera sensor with a pixel size of $\\text{PS}=13$ um, by a telescope with and $\\text{M}=20\\times$ or $\\text{M}=4\\times$ magnification respectively for each lens.\n",

    "With the **Heavy_tails** dataset you will test the ability of a simple linear decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the data and confirm whether the 'compressed' image still retains relevant features of the gas. Images involving gases generated with $\\sigma_z\\gtrsim \\text{DOF}$ will acquire a noticeable tail in the image, diverging from the true Gaussian number density distribution. Of interest is how this tail is carried through to the compressed and reconstructed images. \n"
